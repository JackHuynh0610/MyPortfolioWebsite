# Awesome Portfolio

Welcome to my awesome portfolio website! 🚀 Here, you'll find a glimpse into my journey, skills, and passion for Software Engineering and Programming. I really do appreciate you visit my portfolio!

I build this portfolio during Christmas break of my Sophomore year while trying to learn React and Javascript, this project really help me understand JS and React along with how to design a responsive webpage. 
Although this doesn't go as I expect, if I were to do this again I would do it differently because I repeat myself wayyyyy too much haha. But I don't mind because I'm still trying to learn, but since the code base is pretty small so it's not hard for me to maintain and 
adjust the code. I design it so later in the future I could add more project and information without worrying about restyling which is a good thing. However, this would be so much better if I decided to plan out from the beginning instead of design on the fly haha. Cause I would have reduce the number of file and assets. Either way, I'm happy with the outcome, I learn a lot and give me some motivation for my next/future project. Currently planning on using React and SpringBoot together cause I love java so why not!.
